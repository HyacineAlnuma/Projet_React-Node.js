# Projet Groupomania

## CONTEXT

This is my first project using React and SQL via MySQL. I also used Node.js for the backend part.
This project is about building an enterprise social network. Users are able to create an account, login, create, modify, delete and like posts (containing an image or not), aswell as modify their profiles.
I built all the app from scratch, this is my first functional project that I built entirely, form the design, frontend part all the way to the backend part of it.

## INSTALLATION

### `npm install`

Run this command in the frontend and backend directory in order to install all the packages needed to run the app.

### .env file

Create a .env file in the backend directory in order to create the following environment variables needed to run the app:
    TOKEN_KEY which is the key of the token.
    MYSQL_PASSWORD which is the password of the database.
